## About Intellinote

Intellinote is a multi-platform (web, mobile, and tablet) software
application that helps businesses of all sizes capture, collaborate
and complete work, quickly and easily.

Users can start with capturing any type of data into a note, turn it
into a task, assign it to others, start a discussion around it, add a
file and share â€“ with colleagues, managers, team members, customers,
suppliers, vendors and even classmates. Since all of this is done in
the context of private and public workspaces, users retain end-to-end
control, visibility and security.
